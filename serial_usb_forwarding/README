=== For VirtualBox USB support ===
install virtualbox (from repo or the homepage) + virtualbox-extensions (from the homepage)
add the host user to the vboxusers (check with groups <username>, add with usermod -a -G vboxusers <username>)
disable the EHCI option in the VirtualBox GUI, eventually add a filter rule there if the one in the Vagrant file does not work

to check if the VMs finds the device use
	lsusb
mounting
	sudo fdisk -l
	mkdir /media/tryout
	sudo mount -t vfat /dev/sdb1 /media/tryout -o uid=1000,gid=1000,utf8,dmask=027,fmask=137
		or
	sudo mount -t ntfs-3g /dev/sdb1 /media/external
	sudo umount /dev/sdb1
also look at
	pmount

=== set up forwarding of the serial port ===
to find the serial port 
	dmesg | grep tty
get more information
	sudo setserial -g /dev/tty...
check permissions for the port
	ls -l /dev/ttyACM0
depending on the group that maintains the port in the previous command
	usermod -a -G <group> <username>
	dialout in my case

restart after changing groups
